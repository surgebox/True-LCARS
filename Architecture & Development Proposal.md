# 1.Project Overview
What are we building?
> True-LCARS, inspired by the LCARS computer interface from Star Trek. This will be a Linux desktop enviroment that will provide a graphical desktop shell, system monitoring, application and file control. We are aiming to sell the idea that we captured a real fully functional operating system salvaged from a different part of space.

**Primary Goals**
-Create a functional LCARS-inspired Linux desktop
-Integrate with Linux Fedora
-Provide real-time system information
-Provide application and desktop controls
-Media controls
-Make core functionality independently testable
-Provide a polished graphical experience
  -From bios/boot screen being Star-trek inspired
  -To login Screen being custom
  -To custom animation once login details entered.
  -To custom shutdown animation
**Reaching for the Stars Goals (optional)
-Voice commands
-AI assistance
-Natural-language system commands
-Subtle, immersive, yet non-distracting thematic sounds
-Sky's the limit!
